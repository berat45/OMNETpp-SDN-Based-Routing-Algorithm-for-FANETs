I have designed a Software Defined Networking Based Routing Algorithm that can be applied to 
different types of UAVs. The development environment is OMNET++ and some files are the extended 
version of the AODV branch under the INET framework. This protocol is published on IEEE 
SIU 2022 and on Sakarya University Journal of Computer and Information Sciences.
